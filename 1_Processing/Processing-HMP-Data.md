Processing HMP Data
===================

## Goal

## Tasks
 1. [Select random sample of sequences]()
 2. [Remove Human host reads]()
 3. [Remove duplicate reads]()
 4. [Remove low complexity reads]()
 5. [Check sequence quality]()
 
 All acquired sequencing data had already undergone trimming to remove flanking sequences such as adapters.
