Processing HMP Data
===================

## Goal

## Tasks
 1. [Select random sample of sequences](https://github.com/brady-welsh/campy-perio/blob/master/1_Processing/Processing-HMP-Data.md#1-select-random-sample-of-sequences)
 2. [Remove Human host reads](https://github.com/brady-welsh/campy-perio/blob/master/1_Processing/Processing-HMP-Data.md#2-remove-human-host-reads)
 3. [Remove duplicate reads](https://github.com/brady-welsh/campy-perio/blob/master/1_Processing/Processing-HMP-Data.md#3-remove-duplicate-reads)
 4. [Remove low complexity reads](https://github.com/brady-welsh/campy-perio/blob/master/1_Processing/Processing-HMP-Data.md#4-remove-low-complexity-reads)
 5. [Check sequence quality](https://github.com/brady-welsh/campy-perio/blob/master/1_Processing/Processing-HMP-Data.md#5-check-sequence-quality)
 
 All acquired sequencing data had already undergone trimming to remove flanking sequences such as adapters.
